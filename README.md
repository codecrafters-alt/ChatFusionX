# 🚀 Multi-Chat AI Application

A full-stack multi-chat application with AI integration, built using a modular backend architecture.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Multi-chat system with real-time communication (Socket-based)
- Secure authentication & authorization
- AI-powered responses integrated into backend
- Long-Term Memory using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Vector Database integration for contextual memory retrieval
- Scalable MVC-based backend structure

## 🤖 AI Integration

This project integrates an AI model directly into the backend.  
To enhance contextual conversations, I implemented:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** for intelligent response generation  
- **Vector Database** for long-term memory storage and semantic retrieval  
- Custom AI service layer for structured model interaction  

This allows the application to retrieve relevant past memories and generate context-aware responses.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Socket.io
- Vector Database (for embeddings & memory)
- AI Model Integration (RAG architecture)

## 📂 Architecture

The backend follows a clean modular structure:

- Controllers
- Routes
- Models
- Services (AI & Vector Layer)
- Middleware
- Socket Server

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Frontend UI enhancement
- Deployment & production scaling
- Advanced memory ranking strategies
